# Yavoth-mgn9c-orbiter-V2-Picobilical-mount
A simple mount for the orbiter V2

this mount is set at a 20 degree angle to help reduce strain on the umbilical and toolhead

it also has my little mod of "no loss cable tie" point for the top of the mount so you simply just unscrew the top part and it neatly comes away with the umbilical!

the spacer between the Orbiter V2 and the mount is 20.5mm
